            <p>We really hope you love your new product! But in cases where you want to return a product, here is what you need to know</p>
            <p>We accept returns within 30 days of receipt. The products must be returned in their original packaging. We do not, however, accept returns for custom made jewelry. In those cases we can offer to modify the custom made product instead.</p>

            <h2>Lost or damaged goods</h2>
            <p>If your package is lost during transport or you have received damaged goods, we can either return your money or re-send you the same order. </p>
            <p> The process of handling a lost package is significantly faster, since our packages come with a tracking number. The latter, however, has a longer handling time.</p>
